### Dummy Module (Somemodule)
This module is here just for learning purposes. We can check tests warning of violations of Clean Architecture if:  
* We go to businessentitymodule and add a maven dependency and JPMS module 'requires' to this (somemodule) module.
* Run the tests or compile the project.
